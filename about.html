                    <h3>Deciding on HoLEP</h3><br>
                    <p>Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP)  is a surgery done to relieve urinary blockage created by an enlarged prostate.   Without making any external incisions, a surgical laser is used to completely remove the obstructing tissue.   Once the prostate tissue has been removed, a special device called a morcellator is used to break up the prostate tissue, which is then removed and tested.  HoLEP has several advantages over other surgeries to treat BPH, especially in men with very large prostates (greater than 50ml) and men that require blood thinners.  In addition, HoLEP has a low retreatment rate, less than 1% of patients requiring additional procedures after 10 years.  </p>

                    <h3>Prior to Surgery</h3><br>
                    <p>A pre-operative history and physical (H&P) will be performed either with a Urology Advanced Practice Provider or your Primary Care Physician.  If a Urinary tract infection is diagnosed prior to surgery, please take antibiotics as directed.  Infected urine on the day of surgery will result in cancellation of the procedure.  Follow instructions provided at the Pre-Operative H&P regarding which medications should be held or continued prior to surgery.  </p>

                    <h3>Day of Surgery</h3><br>
                    <p>Surgery may take between 1-3 hours, depending on the size of the prostate.  At the end of surgery, a urinary catheter is placed and continuous irrigation is started.  Shortly after surgery, the irrigation is stopped and most patients are discharged home with the catheter within 2-3 hours of surgery.  Nursing staff will assist you with proper catheter management techniques.  Occasionally, overnight admission to the hospital is needed for monitoring of urine drainage.  </p>

                    <h3>Recovery and Activity Restrictions</h3><br>
                    <p>For the first few days after surgery, especially while the catheter is in place, activity should be limited to careful walking and avoidance of all strenuous activity, including straining with bowel movements. Sometimes a stool softener is necessary to maintain a soft, easy bowel movements during the recovery period.  Do not lift more than 20 lb while there is still visible blood in the urine.  This may last 2-3 weeks after surgery, potentially longer if you are taking a blood thinner.  </p>
                    <p>One of the most important parts of recovery is to drink large volumes of fluid.   For the first 2 weeks after surgery, it is recommended that patients drink at least 96oz of water a day but no more than 128oz.  This helps to keep the urine diluted and to minimize clotting of any blood in the urine.  </p>
                    <p>Most men experience very little pain after surgery.  However, it is common to have an intense sensation of urinary urgency (feeling like you need to urinate) even though the catheter is draining.  This sensation is most intense immediately after surgery while the catheter is in place, but may persist after catheter removal as the surgical area is healing.  Acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours as needed can be taken for this discomfort.  </p>
                    <p>The catheter is usually removed within 2-5 days of surgery.    After catheter removal, some men will experience temporary leakage of urine.  It is best to prepare yourself by purchasing protective pads to collect any urine leakage.   It is also very common to experience worsening urinary urgency and frequency, in addition to the incontinence, for up to 3 months after surgery.  Your Surgeon may recommend Pelvic Physical therapy to strengthen the pelvic muscles before or after surgery. </p>
                    <p>Because of the removal of the prostate tissue, there will no longer be any fluid with ejaculation.  Erections may be temporarily impaired after surgery, but after a recovery period of 3-6 months, most men resume normal sexual activity. Occasionally a medication such as Viagra (sildenafil) may be needed to assist with erectile function.  </p>
                    <p>The large surface area where the prostate tissue was removed will go through various stages of healing in the months after surgery.  Most men will find that they start passing pieces of tissue in their urine, a normal finding as the internal “scab” sloughs off during the healing process.  </p>
